## Authentication Refactoring Plan Update

### Completed Steps:

1. **JWT Authentication Service (JWTAuthService.php):**
   - Implemented functions to generate, validate, and refresh JWT tokens.
   - Integrated jwt-fix.php functions for JWT operations.

2. **WordPress Authentication Service (WPAuthService.php):**
   - Created a basic service to validate requests via WordPress authentication cookies.
   - Placeholder implementation to simulate WordPress user validation.

3. **Unified Authentication Adapter (AuthAdapter.php):**
   - Developed an adapter that checks for a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
   - Falls back to WordPress authentication if a JWT is not provided or is invalid.

4. **Endpoint Updates:**
   - Updated `customers/list.php` to use the unified authentication adapter.
   - Created a simplified `login.php` endpoint that uses placeholder credentials ('admin'/'secret') to generate a JWT token.
   - Developed a `refresh.php` endpoint to refresh tokens using JWTAuthService.

### Next Steps:

- **Further Testing:** Verify all endpoints work correctly with the new authentication flow.
- **Security Enhancements:** Integrate proper error handling, CSRF token validation for non-GET requests, and improve WPAuthService for production.
- **Frontend Integration:** Update frontend calls to use the new authentication scheme, including sending the Bearer token and handling token refresh logic.
- **Deprecate Old Flow:** Phase out the dual WordPress/JWT authentication logic once the new unified flow is stable.

This update confirms that the unified authentication flow is now in place. Let's proceed with testing and further integration as outlined above.
