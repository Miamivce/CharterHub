## Authentication System Improvements - Technical Documentation

### Problem Statement
Users reported experiencing automatic logouts in two scenarios: (1) when reloading pages, and (2) after approximately 5 minutes of activity. These issues were causing significant disruption to user workflow and created a poor user experience, particularly for clients managing lengthy booking processes.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Page Reload Logout Issue**: The `initAuth` function in `AuthContext.tsx` had deficiencies in token validation and refreshing, causing users to be logged out during page reloads.
2. **5-minute Auto-logout Issue**: The connection test interval (`setInterval(testConnection, 5 * 60 * 1000)`) was checking the connection every 5 minutes but not proactively refreshing the authentication token.
3. **Token Refresh Error Handling**: The token refresh mechanism was too aggressive in clearing tokens during network errors or temporary API unavailability.

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. Proactive Token Refresh Mechanism
- Added a token refresh interval that runs every 4 minutes (before the 5-minute connection test)
- This ensures tokens remain valid even during periods of inactivity
- The refresh only occurs when a user is actually logged in

```typescript
// Added to AuthContext.tsx
// Setup a proactive token refresh every 4 minutes to prevent expiration
// This is less than the connection test interval (5 minutes)
const tokenRefreshId = setInterval(async () => {
  // Only refresh if we have a user logged in
  if (user) {
    try {
      console.log('Performing proactive token refresh');
      await refreshTokenIfNeeded();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Proactive token refresh failed:', error);
    }
  }
}, 4 * 60 * 1000);
```

#### 2. Improved Token Refresh Error Handling
- Enhanced the `refreshToken` function in `wpApi.ts` to be more resilient
- Added differentiation between network errors and authentication failures
- Token clearing now only occurs on definite authentication failures (HTTP status 401 or 403)
- Network errors or temporary API unavailability no longer cause sessions to be terminated

```typescript
// Modified in wpApi.ts
async refreshToken() {
  try {
    // Refresh token implementation
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Only clear tokens on definite authentication failures
    if (error instanceof ApiError && (error.status === 401 || error.status === 403)) {
      // Clear tokens on authentication failures
      localStorage.removeItem('auth_token');
      // ...
      console.log('Tokens cleared due to authentication failure');
    } else if (axios.isAxiosError(error) && (!error.response || error.code === 'ECONNABORTED')) {
      // Do not clear tokens on network errors
      console.log('Network error during token refresh, tokens preserved');
      // ...
    } else {
      // Handle unexpected errors
      // ...
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced getCurrentUser Method
- Updated the `getCurrentUser` method in `wpApi.ts` to better handle token issues
- Implemented retry logic to attempt token refresh before logging users out
- Added safeguards against clearing tokens during temporary network issues

### Testing Results
The improvements have been tested across various scenarios:
- Page reloads now properly maintain user sessions
- The application remains logged in well beyond the previous 5-minute limit
- Authentication is maintained even during brief network interruptions
- Token refreshing occurs silently in the background without disrupting user experience

### Next Steps
- Continue monitoring user reports to ensure the authentication issues have been fully resolved
- Consider implementing a more sophisticated token refresh strategy based on token expiration time
- Add more comprehensive logging to track authentication-related events for easier troubleshooting

## Customer Registration Fix - Technical Documentation

### Problem Statement
Users reported that when creating a new customer via the "+ new customer" option during the booking process, the customer was not appearing in the Customers submenu. The issue was that clicking "create customer" in the modal redirected the user back to the booking overview page before the customer data was fully processed and saved.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Premature Modal Closing**: The customer creation modal was closing immediately after API calls, before data was fully processed
2. **Navigation Interruption**: Form submission was causing navigation events that interrupted the customer registration process
3. **Race Conditions**: Customer selection callbacks were being triggered before customer data was fully saved
4. **Synchronization Issues**: There were inconsistencies between in-memory customer arrays and local storage
5. **Inadequate Feedback**: Users had no confirmation that customer creation was successful

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced `CreateCustomerModal` Component
- Added explicit success confirmation screen after customer creation
- Implemented a required "Continue" button to prevent premature navigation
- Prevented automatic modal closing with the `preventAutoClose` property
- Added proper form submission handling with event prevention (`e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()`)
- Improved state management to track the customer creation process
- Added delay for callback execution to ensure data synchronization

```typescript
// Key improvements in CreateCustomerModal
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  // Explicitly prevent form submission to avoid any navigation
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  
  // ...customer creation logic...
  
  // Only call onCreateCustomer after a delay to ensure all state updates occur
  setTimeout(() => {
    onCreateCustomer(customer);
  }, 500);
};

// Added explicit user continuation flow
const handleContinue = () => {
  // Reset all state
  // ...
  onClose();
};

// Success state view in render
{showSuccessMessage && customerCreated ? (
  // Success screen with Continue button
) : (
  // Form view
)}
```

#### 2. Updated `Modal` Component
- Added `preventAutoClose` property to prevent accidental closing
- Modified backdrop click handler to respect this setting
- Enhanced focus management and keyboard accessibility

```typescript
export interface ModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean
  onClose: () => void
  children: React.ReactNode
  preventAutoClose?: boolean
}

// Modified handler for backdrop clicks
const handleBackdropClick = () => {
  // If preventAutoClose is true, don't close the modal when clicking outside
  if (!preventAutoClose) {
    onClose()
  }
}
```

#### 3. Improved `CustomerSearch` Component
- Created a more robust customer selection process with proper timing
- Added state tracking for newly created customers
- Implemented proper dropdown UI for better user experience
- Added explicit delays to ensure data synchronization before callbacks

```typescript
const handleCreateCustomer = (newCustomer: ClientUser) => {
  setIsCreatingCustomer(true);
  setJustCreatedCustomerId(newCustomer.id);
  
  // Reload customers with delays to ensure proper synchronization
  setTimeout(async () => {
    await loadCustomers();
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      handleCustomerSelect(newCustomer);
      setIsCreatingCustomer(false);
    }, 700);
  }, 500);
}
```

#### 4. Created New UI Components
- Added `Dropdown` and `DropdownItem` components for better customer selection
- Ensured proper keyboard accessibility and styling

#### 5. Enhanced `customerService` Implementation
- Added UUID generation for reliable customer IDs
- Improved data synchronization between in-memory arrays and local storage
- Added extensive logging for better diagnostic visibility
- Fixed customer data persistence during the booking process

### Testing
The fix has been tested with the following scenarios:
- Creating a new customer during the booking process
- Verifying the customer appears in the customers submenu
- Checking that navigation only occurs after explicit user action
- Ensuring proper data persistence in local storage

### Next Steps
- Monitor the application for any remaining issues with customer registration
- Consider adding automated tests for the customer creation flow
- Review other modal-based forms for similar issues

## Deployment Notes
The fixes have been implemented in the following files:
- `frontend/src/components/customer/CreateCustomerModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/shared/Modal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/customer/CustomerSearch.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/shared/Dropdown.tsx`
- `frontend/src/services/customerService.ts`

No database schema changes or server-side API changes were required for these fixes.
