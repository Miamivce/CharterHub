# Authentication System Production Checklist

This document outlines the steps required before deploying the enhanced authentication system to production.

## Configuration Settings

- [ ] Change `DEVELOPMENT_MODE` in `backend/auth/config.php` to `false`
- [ ] Update JWT secret key in production configuration (DO NOT use the development key)
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings with specific Origin headers
- [ ] Set up proper email configuration for verification and password reset emails
- [ ] Review and adjust rate limiting settings if needed (`max_login_attempts` and `lockout_time`)

## Security Hardening

- [ ] Ensure all sensitive API endpoints validate CSRF tokens
- [ ] Verify CSRF token is cleared during logout process
- [ ] Confirm login process obtains fresh CSRF token before submission
- [ ] Test auto-retry mechanism for CSRF token errors
- [ ] Implement proper SSL/TLS configuration on all endpoints
- [ ] Set secure and HTTP-only flags for cookies in production
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- [ ] Implement XSS protection headers
- [ ] Configure database connection security (least privilege principles)

## Monitoring and Logging

- [ ] Set up logging for authentication events (successful and failed logins)
- [ ] Configure alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts)
- [ ] Implement monitoring for API endpoint health and performance
- [ ] Set up error reporting and notification system

## Database Considerations

- [ ] Create and configure database tables for auth logs
- [ ] Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- [ ] Implement scheduled cleaning of old log entries
- [ ] Set up database backup schedule for auth-related tables

## Frontend Optimizations

- [ ] Implement token renewal without page reload
- [ ] Add graceful handling of session expiration
- [ ] Ensure proper error messages are displayed to users
- [ ] Verify that login forms have appropriate security attributes (autocomplete, etc.)

## Testing Before Deployment

- [ ] Perform security testing (penetration testing if possible)
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality in staging environment
- [ ] Verify CSRF protection across all sensitive operations
- [ ] Test logout-login cycle to confirm CSRF token refresh is working
- [ ] Test login auto-retry logic with invalid CSRF tokens
- [ ] Test token refresh mechanism under various network conditions
- [ ] Test login/logout flow across different browsers and devices
- [ ] Verify that error handling works correctly in production mode

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Monitor authentication logs for unusual activities
- [ ] Verify that rate limiting is working correctly
- [ ] Test forgotten password and email verification flows
- [ ] Confirm that session timeouts are working as expected
- [ ] Check that CSRF protection is properly preventing cross-site attacks

## Future Security Enhancements

- [ ] Consider implementing two-factor authentication
- [ ] Review password policies and implement password complexity requirements
- [ ] Set up regular security assessments
- [ ] Implement account lockout notification to users

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update user documentation regarding new security features
- [ ] Create admin documentation for monitoring authentication activities
- [ ] Document incident response procedures for authentication-related issues
