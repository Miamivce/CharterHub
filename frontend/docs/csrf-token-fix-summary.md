# CSRF Token Validation Fix Summary

## Issue Description

Users were experiencing `400 (Bad Request)` errors related to CSRF token validation after logging out and attempting to log in again. The server logs showed the following error:

```
Login error: Invalid security token. Please reload the page and try again.
```

This error occurred because the CSRF token was not being properly refreshed during the logout-login cycle, causing the server to reject login attempts with stale tokens.

## Root Cause

1. When a user logged out, the CSRF token stored in session storage was not being explicitly cleared
2. When attempting to log in again, the login process was using a stale token or no token at all
3. The server correctly rejected these requests due to invalid CSRF tokens
4. The error handling did not automatically recover from this specific error condition

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Logout Process

Updated the `logout` function in `wpApi.ts` to explicitly clear the CSRF token:

```typescript
// Clear CSRF token as well
sessionStorage.removeItem(CSRF_TOKEN_KEY);
```

### 2. Improved Login Process

Enhanced the `login` function in `wpApi.ts` to:
- Fetch a fresh CSRF token before every login attempt
- Include auto-retry logic for CSRF token errors

```typescript
// Always fetch a fresh CSRF token before login attempt
await this.getCSRFToken();

// Get the newly fetched CSRF token
const csrfToken = getCSRFToken();
```

### 3. Added Auto-Retry Logic

Implemented automatic retry with a fresh token when CSRF token errors occur:

```typescript
// Check for CSRF errors
if (error.response.data?.message?.includes('CSRF') || 
    error.response.data?.message?.includes('security token')) {
    
    // Auto-retry with a fresh token (once)
    try {
        console.log('CSRF token error detected. Fetching new token and retrying login...');
        
        // Get new token
        await this.getCSRFToken();
        
        // Retry login with new token
        return await this.login({ email, password, rememberMe });
    } catch (retryError) {
        console.error('Login retry after CSRF token refresh failed:', retryError);
        // If retry also fails, throw a more helpful error
        throw new ApiError('Your session has expired. Please refresh the page and try again.');
    }
}
```

### 4. Proactive Token Fetching

Added a `useEffect` hook to the `Login` component to fetch a fresh CSRF token when the component mounts:

```typescript
// Fetch a fresh CSRF token when component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  wpApi.getCSRFToken()
    .catch(err => {
      console.error('Failed to fetch CSRF token:', err);
    });
}, []);
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Users can now log out and log in again without encountering CSRF validation errors
2. **Better User Experience**: The system automatically recovers from token validation issues
3. **Enhanced Security**: CSRF protection remains in place, but now works seamlessly across the authentication flow
4. **Reduced Support Issues**: Fewer errors mean fewer support tickets related to login problems

## Testing

The fix was tested by:
1. Logging in to the application
2. Logging out
3. Attempting to log in again
4. Verifying that no CSRF token errors occurred

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation files were updated to reflect these changes:
- `auth-fixes.md`: Added the CSRF token handling improvements to the list of completed fixes
- `frontend/docs/auth-security-enhancements.md`: Enhanced the CSRF Protection section with the new improvements
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Added the CSRF token validation fixes to version 1.3.0
- `frontend/docs/auth-production-checklist.md`: Added specific testing items for the CSRF token validation improvements

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider implementing client-side CSRF token refreshing via a scheduled interval
2. Add more robust error handling for other token-related scenarios
3. Include additional logging to track CSRF token validation issues in production
