# JWT Authentication Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the test plan for the JWT authentication system in the CharterHub application. The test plan covers all migrated components and authentication flows to ensure the system works correctly and reliably.

## Test Environments

- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment with test data
- **Production**: Live environment (for final verification only)

## Test Categories

| E2E-07 | Token Management | Token refresh | Access token is refreshed automatically |
| E2E-08 | Token Management | Session expiration | User is redirected to login after session expires |

### 4. Edge Cases and Error Handling

| Test ID | Scenario | Test Description | Expected Result |
|---------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| EC-01 | Network Error | Test login with network error | Appropriate error message is displayed |
| EC-02 | Invalid Credentials | Test login with invalid credentials | Error message indicates invalid credentials |
| EC-03 | Token Expiration | Test behavior when token expires | Token is refreshed or user is redirected to login |
| EC-04 | Concurrent Requests | Test multiple API requests | All requests are authenticated correctly |
| EC-05 | Session Timeout | Test behavior after session timeout | User is redirected to login with appropriate message |
| EC-06 | Browser Storage | Test with localStorage disabled | Appropriate fallback or error message is displayed |
| EC-07 | Profile Update Conflict | Test concurrent profile updates | Updates are handled correctly without data loss |

## Test Procedures

### Authentication Flow Tests

#### Login Flow (E2E-01)

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Click the login button
4. Verify the user is redirected to the dashboard
5. Verify the user's information is displayed correctly
6. Verify protected routes are accessible

#### Logout Flow (E2E-02)

1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Navigate to any page with a logout button
3. Click the logout button
4. Verify the user is redirected to the login page
5. Verify protected routes are no longer accessible
6. Verify the authentication token is removed from storage

#### Remember Me Functionality (E2E-03)

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Check the "Remember Me" checkbox
4. Click the login button
5. Close the browser and reopen it
6. Navigate to the application
7. Verify the user is still authenticated
8. Repeat without "Remember Me" and verify the user is logged out

### Profile Management Tests

#### Update Profile Information (E2E-04)

1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Navigate to the profile page
3. Update profile information
4. Save the changes
5. Verify the changes are saved successfully
6. Refresh the page
7. Verify the updated information is displayed
8. Navigate to another page and back to the profile
9. Verify the updated information is still displayed

### Role-Based Access Tests

#### Admin Role Access (E2E-05)

1. Log in with admin credentials
2. Verify access to admin-only routes
3. Verify access to client routes

#### Client Role Access (E2E-06)

1. Log in with client credentials
2. Verify access to client routes
3. Attempt to access admin-only routes
4. Verify redirection to appropriate page

### Token Management Tests

#### Token Refresh (E2E-07)

1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Modify the access token to expire soon (for testing)
3. Perform an authenticated action after token expiration
4. Verify the token is refreshed automatically
5. Verify the action completes successfully

#### Session Expiration (E2E-08)

1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Modify both access and refresh tokens to expire soon
3. Wait for token expiration
4. Attempt to perform an authenticated action
5. Verify the user is redirected to login
6. Verify appropriate message is displayed
