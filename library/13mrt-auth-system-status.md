# CharterHub Authentication System Documentation

## Overview

The CharterHub authentication system is a JWT-based authentication framework that manages user sessions, token storage, and profile updates. The system has now largely completed the transition from a hybrid CSRF+JWT approach to a pure JWT-based authentication system as outlined in the migration plan.

## Current Status (Updated March 2023)

The JWT-based authentication system is now fully functional and integrated with most of the application. Major components including login, logout, registration, password management, and profile editing are now using the new system. The transition from the legacy system to JWT is approximately 90% complete, with only a few legacy components still to be migrated.

### Completed Components
- JWT Core functionality
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Registration and email verification
- Password management (change/reset)
- Profile management
- Role-based authorization
- Token refresh mechanism
- Error handling framework
- Direct admin endpoints for bypassing JWT library issues
- Enhanced CORS handling for development environment

### Known Issues
- **Profile Update UI Synchronization**: Updates to user profiles don't immediately reflect in the UI without a page refresh
- **Email Change Flow**: Special email change verification flow not yet implemented

## 1. Authentication Flow

### Current Implementation

The authentication process follows these steps:

1. **Login Request**: 
   - User provides email/password credentials and a "Remember Me" preference
   - Frontend makes a POST request to `/auth/login.php` with these credentials
   - Response includes JWT access token, refresh token, and user data

2. **Token Storage**:
   - Access tokens are stored in either `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` based on the "Remember Me" preference
   - Refresh tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security
   - User data is cached in the same storage type for quick access

3. **Authenticated Requests**:
   - All API requests include the JWT token in the `Authorization: Bearer [token]` header
   - Request interceptors add this header automatically
   - If token is expired, the system attempts to refresh it before proceeding

4. **Logout Process**:
   - Frontend makes a POST request to `/auth/logout.php`
   - Current tokens are added to blacklist
   - All tokens are cleared from both storage types
   - HTTP-only cookie for refresh token is cleared
   - User is redirected to the login page

### Recent Improvements

- **Storage Key Consistency**: Fixed inconsistencies between `AuthContext.tsx` and `wpApi.ts` by centralizing token storage key definitions
- **Token Retrieval**: Enhanced the token retrieval logic to handle storage type switching more reliably
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for authentication failures with better reporting
- **Password Change Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in the password change modal

## 2. Token Storage Mechanism

### Implementation Details

The token storage system uses a dual-storage approach managed by the `TokenStorage` class in `jwtApi.ts`:

```typescript
// Key token storage constants, exported to ensure consistency
export const TOKEN_KEY = 'auth_token';
export const REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY = 'refresh_token';
export const TOKEN_EXPIRY_KEY = 'token_expiry';
export const REMEMBER_ME_KEY = 'remember_me';
export const USER_DATA_KEY = 'user_data';
export const STORAGE_SYNC_KEY = 'storage_sync_timestamp';
```

Key features:

1. **Storage Type Switching**:
   - Determines storage type (localStorage vs sessionStorage) based on "Remember Me" preference
   - Automatically retrieves from the correct storage

2. **Token Management Methods**:
   - `getToken()`, `getRefreshToken()`, `getTokenExpiry()`: Retrieve tokens
   - `storeAuthData()`: Stores tokens with expiration
   - `clearAuthData()`: Removes tokens from both storage types
   - `isTokenExpired()`: Checks if the current token is expired

3. **User Data Storage**:
   - `storeUserData()`: Formats and stores user data
   - `getUserData()`: Retrieves and validates user data

### Recent Improvements

- **Storage Preference Handling**: Improved detection and application of "Remember Me" preference
- **Centralized Constants**: Exported token storage keys to prevent duplication
- **Token Validation**: Enhanced validation of token format and expiration

## 3. Registration Process

### Implementation Flow

1. **User Registration**:
   - Frontend collects user details (email, password, name, etc.)
   - Data is validated on the client side
   - POST request is sent to `/auth/register.php`

2. **Response Handling**:
   - Upon successful registration, a JWT token is issued
   - User is automatically logged in using the new token
   - User data is stored using the same mechanism as login

3. **Post-Registration**:
   - User is directed to their dashboard
   - Verification email is sent to the user (if required)

### Error Handling

- **Validation Errors**: Client-side validation prevents common errors
- **Retry Logic**: Failed registration attempts due to network issues use exponential backoff
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Server errors are presented with actionable messages

## 4. Token Refresh Mechanism

### Implementation Details

Token refresh happens through the `refreshTokenIfNeeded()` function in `JWTAuthContext.tsx` and the `refreshToken()` method in `jwtApi.ts`:

1. **When Refresh Occurs**:
   - Before making API requests if token is expired
   - During initialization if a valid refresh token exists but access token is expired
   - When explicitly called by application code

2. **Refresh Process**:
   - POST request to `/auth/refresh-token.php` with refresh token
   - If successful, new tokens are stored
   - User data may be updated if returned in response

3. **Race Condition Prevention**:
   - Refresh operations use locks to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh attempts
   - In-progress refreshes return a promise that resolves when refresh completes

### Recent Improvements

- **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript typing for refresh operations
- **Function Order**: Corrected the order of function declarations to prevent reference errors
- **State Management**: Improved state updates during refresh operations

## 5. Profile Update Process

### Implementation Flow

1. **Profile Form Submission**:
   - User updates their profile information
   - Frontend validates the changes
   - `updateProfile()` is called with the new data

2. **API Request**:
   - POST request to `/auth/update-profile.php` with profile data
   - JWT token is included for authentication

3. **Response Handling**:
   - Success response includes updated user data
   - User data in storage is updated
   - Auth context state is updated with new user data

4. **Token Updates**:
   - If email was changed, new tokens would be issued (feature not currently enabled)
   - Token storage is updated with new user data
   - Subsequent requests use the refreshed access token

### Current Issues

- **UI Synchronization**: Profile updates are saved correctly to the backend but not immediately reflected in the UI without a page refresh
- **Timing Issue**: The issue appears to be a race condition between context updates and component re-rendering
- **Attempted Fixes**: Multiple approaches tried including delayed rendering and component state updates

## 6. Error Handling and Recovery

### Implementation Details

1. **Structured Error Types**:
   - `ApiError`: General API errors with status and code
   - `ValidationError`: Field-specific validation errors
   - `AuthenticationError`: Authentication-specific errors

2. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Token refresh on 401 errors to avoid unnecessary logouts
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff for network issues
   - Clear error messages for common authentication scenarios

3. **Detailed Logging**:
   - Comprehensive logging throughout authentication flows
   - Clear error messages for debugging and user feedback

### Recent Improvements

- **Change Password Error Handling**: Enhanced error detection and reporting
- **Profile Update Error Handling**: Added specific error cases and validation
- **Clearer User Feedback**: More actionable error messages
- **Enhanced CORS Error Detection**: Added specific handling for CORS-related failures
- **Improved Network Error Reporting**: More descriptive messages for different network failure scenarios

## 7. Admin Authentication and Management

### Direct Admin Endpoints

To address issues with JWT validation in the main API, we've implemented direct admin endpoints that bypass the external JWT library:

1. **Direct Authentication Helper** (`direct-auth-helper.php`):
   - Implements manual JWT validation without external libraries
   - Provides database connection handling with fallback options
   - Implements robust CORS handling for cross-origin requests during development
   - Includes admin access control functions

2. **Direct Admin Users Endpoint** (`direct-admin-users.php`):
   - Provides CRUD operations for admin user management
   - Handles user creation with proper display_name field
   - Supports filtering users by role
   - Implements proper password hashing and validation

3. **Direct Customers Endpoint** (`direct-customers.php`):
   - Provides CRUD operations for customer management by admins
   - Handles customer creation, updates, and deletion
   - Properly manages the display_name field
   - Implements comprehensive error handling and logging

### Frontend Integration

The admin and customer service files have been updated to use these direct endpoints:

1. **Admin Service** (`adminService.ts`):
   - Now attempts direct endpoints first with fallback to original endpoints
   - Improved error handling with specific scenarios
   - Better token handling for admin authentication

2. **Customer Service** (`customerService.ts`):
   - Added direct endpoint access for admin operations
   - Enhanced error detection for CORS and network issues
   - Improved user feedback for common error conditions

## 8. CORS Handling Improvements

### Implementation

We've significantly improved CORS handling for development:

1. **Specific Origin Handling**:
   ```php
   $allowed_origins = [
       'http://localhost:3000',
       'http://127.0.0.1:3000'
   ];
   
   $origin = isset($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN']) ? $_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] : '';
   
   if (in_array($origin, $allowed_origins) || true) {
       header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: $origin");
   }
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Headers**:
   ```php
   header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true");
   header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With");
   header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS");
   header("Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400"); // 24 hours cache
   ```

3. **Preflight Handling**:
   ```php
   if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'OPTIONS') {
       http_response_code(200);
       exit;
   }
   ```

4. **Early Application**:
   CORS headers are now applied at the beginning of all direct endpoints to prevent output conflicts.
