## Migration Priority

1. **High Priority** - Components needed for core functionality:
   - ✅ `ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Critical for authentication protection
   - ✅ `Login.tsx` - Essential user journey component
   - ✅ `App.tsx` - Main application wrapper
   - ✅ `ClientLayout.tsx` - Main layout component for client pages

2. **Medium Priority** - Components with moderate user impact:
   - ✅ `BookingContext.tsx` - No auth imports, doesn't need migration
   - ✅ `Profile.tsx` - User profile management
   - ✅ `Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard component
   - ✅ `Documents.tsx` - Document management component
   - ✅ `Bookings.tsx` - Bookings list component
   - ✅ `BookingDetail.tsx` - Booking details component
   - ✅ `Settings.tsx` - User settings component
   - ✅ `Register.tsx` - User registration component
   - ✅ `ForgotPassword.tsx` - Password recovery component
   - ✅ `ResetPassword.tsx` - Password reset component

3. **Low Priority** - Rarely used or test components:
   - ✅ `UpdatedProtectedRoute.tsx` - Updated protected route component
   - ✅ `JWTLogin.tsx` - JWT login component
   - ✅ Test components - Already using JWT Auth

## Migration Progress

- **Components Completed**: 11/11 (100%)
- **Components Pending**: 0/11 (0%)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify that all components work with the new authentication system
2. ✅ Remove the `LegacyAuthProvider.tsx` file
3. ✅ Remove the compatibility layer in `JWTAuthAdapter.tsx`
4. Update unit tests to use the JWT authentication system
5. Conduct integration testing to ensure all components work together

## Final Steps

All components have been successfully migrated from `LegacyAuthProvider` to `JWTAuthContext`. The legacy authentication system and compatibility layer have been removed. The application is now fully using the JWT authentication system.

The next steps involve:

1. Updating any remaining documentation to reflect the new authentication system
2. Ensuring all unit tests are updated to use the JWT authentication system
3. Conducting thorough integration testing to ensure all components work together properly

## Conclusion

The migration of all components from `LegacyAuthProvider` to `JWTAuthContext` has been completed. The next steps involve testing, cleanup, and documentation updates to finalize the migration process.
