- ✅ Developed TokenStorage mechanism for secure token handling
- ✅ Implemented JWTAuthContext as central auth state manager
- ✅ Created compatibility layer (LegacyAuthProvider)
- ✅ Updated AppRouter and protected routes
- ✅ Updated main user components (Login, Signup, Profile)
- ✅ Migrated legacy authentication components: 11/11 (100%)
- ⏳ Frontend integration with new auth system (In Progress)
- ⏳ Testing and validation (Pending)

## Known Issues

### Profile Update UI Synchronization
- **Description:** Updates to the user profile are saved correctly but not immediately visible in the UI until page refresh
- **Status:** Identified timing issue between context updates and component re-rendering
- **Attempted Fixes:**
  1. Added refreshUserData() after profile update (caused stale data issues)
  2. Removed redundant refreshUserData() call (did not resolve synchronization)
  3. Added delay before exiting edit mode (did not fully resolve the issue)
- **Next Steps:** More thorough investigation of the component / context relationship

## Frontend Integration Guide

### Overview
The new JWT authentication system provides several key improvements:

1. **Secure Token Storage**
   - Access tokens stored in memory/storage
   - Refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies
   - Automatic token refresh

2. **Role-Based Authorization**
   - User roles and permissions in token claims
   - Easy checking of permissions with JWTProtectedRoute
   
3. **Consistent Error Handling**
   - Standardized error responses
   - Detailed validation errors
   
4. **Remember Me Functionality**
   - Switch between session and local storage

### Implementation Options

#### Option 1: Direct Migration to JWTAuthContext
For new components or full rewrites, use the new JWT auth context directly:

```tsx
import { useJWTAuth } from '@/contexts/auth/JWTAuthContext';
import { JWTProtectedRoute } from '@/components/shared/JWTProtectedRoute';

// In your component
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { user, login, logout, loading, errors } = useJWTAuth();
  
  // Use the JWT authentication directly
  return (
    <div>
      {user ? (
        <button onClick={logout}>Logout {user.firstName}</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => login('user@example.com', 'password')}>Login</button>
      )}
      {loading.login && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {errors.login && <span>Error: {errors.login.message}</span>}
    </div>
  );
};

// In your routes
const AppRoutes = () => (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/login" element={<JWTLogin />} />
    <Route 
      path="/protected" 
      element={
        <JWTProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['admin']}>
          <AdminComponent />
        </JWTProtectedRoute>
      } 
    />
  </Routes>
);
```

#### Option 2: Gradual Migration with Compatibility Layer
For existing components, use the compatibility layer to maintain the same interface:

1. Replace imports in your component:
```tsx
// OLD
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/auth/AuthContext';

// NEW
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/auth/LegacyAuthProvider';
```

2. Replace the provider in your app root:
```tsx
// OLD
<AuthProvider>
  <App />
</AuthProvider>

// NEW
<LegacyAuthProvider>
  <App />
</LegacyAuthProvider>
```

3. Update the path if needed to point to the new location:
```tsx
// If your file is in src/ and the LegacyAuthProvider is in frontend/src/
import { useAuth } from '../../../frontend/src/contexts/auth/LegacyAuthProvider';
```

### JWT Demo
A complete demo of the new authentication system is available at `/jwt-demo`. It demonstrates:

1. **Login Flow**
   - Form validation
   - Success/error handling
   - Remember me functionality
   
2. **Profile Management**
   - View and edit user data
   - Change password
   
3. **Automatic Token Refresh**
   - Handles expired tokens
   
4. **Role-based Authorization**
   - Different content for admin/client roles

### Known Limitations
1. **Profile Updates UI Synchronization**
   - Profile updates are saved correctly to the backend
   - UI may not immediately reflect changes without page refresh
   - Workaround: Refresh the page after making profile changes

2. **Email Changes**
   - Email changes require special verification
   - Not implemented in the current version
   - Contact support for email address changes

### Migration Steps
1. Update components to use the new JWT auth context
2. Replace existing ProtectedRoute with JWTProtectedRoute for role-based authorization
3. Ensure API calls use the JWT token for authentication
4. Clean up legacy authentication code
