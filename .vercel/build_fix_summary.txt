# TypeScript Errors Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues:

1. **Toast Component**:
   - Made `toast` function directly callable by using Object.assign
   - Created proper ToastProps interface

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Created proper environment variable typings in env.d.ts
   - Added missing environment variables to .env file

3. **Role Standardization**:
   - Fixed `auth.ts` to consistently use 'client' instead of 'customer'
   - Updated user type handling in registration and login flows

4. **CustomerDetails Component**:
   - Completely rebuilt the component with proper state management
   - Fixed undefined variable errors

5. **Import Paths**:
   - Checked UI component imports and case sensitivity

## Remaining Issues:

1. **DocumentContext**:
   - The showNotification calls are still problematic - need to check its implementation

2. **BookingForm**:
   - BookingForm component still has type mismatches with guestList vs guests

3. **Test Files**:
   - Need to fix test dependencies or exclude tests from build
   - Files like auth-test.tsx have multiple errors

4. **JWTProfile Props**:
   - Missing properties in JWTAuthContextType

5. **Inconsistent Button Imports**:
   - Some files use `@/components/ui/Button` and others use `@/components/ui/button`

## Next Steps:

1. Fix inconsistent Button imports by renaming the file to be all lowercase or all uppercase
2. Update the showNotification implementation to accept object types
3. Fix the remaining issues with BookingForm
4. Add proper typings for JWTAuthContextType
5. Exclude test files from the build or fix their dependencies

Overall, the most critical and common errors have been addressed, particularly the environment variables and toast function issues which caused many errors. The remaining issues are more localized to specific components.
