### Registration and Verification System Fixes

- Implemented development mode verification endpoints
- Fixed auth_logs table structure for proper logging
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the system

### Database Schema Updates
- Created/Updated auth_logs table with proper column sizes:
  - `action` column increased to VARCHAR(50)
  - Added proper indexes for performance
  - Improved logging of registration and verification events
- Ensured proper username handling in charterhub_clients table
- Added verification token storage

### Current System Status

#### Users Table (wp_charterhub_clients)
- Working as expected with following fields:
  - username (auto-generated from firstName + lastName)
  - email (stored in lowercase)
  - password (properly hashed)
  - first_name, last_name
  - verified status
  - verification_token
  - created_at timestamp

#### Auth Logs (wp_charterhub_auth_logs)
- Successfully logging all authentication events:
  - User registration
  - Email verification
  - Login attempts
  - Development mode verifications
- Proper column sizes for all fields
- Detailed JSON data in details column

### Verification Flow
1. User registers → Account created with verified=0
2. Development Mode:
   - Verification URL returned directly in response
   - Can use dev-verify-account.php for immediate verification
   - Status checkable via check-verification.php
3. Production Mode:
   - Verification email sent
   - User clicks link to verify
   - Redirected to login after verification

### Recent Fixes
1. **Username Generation**:
   - Removes special characters
   - Handles duplicate usernames with numeric suffixes
   - Provides fallback for invalid names

2. **Auth Logging**:
   - Fixed data truncation issues
   - Improved log detail structure
   - Added development mode indicators

3. **Verification System**:
   - Streamlined verification URLs
   - Added development shortcuts
   - Improved error handling

## Previously Completed Changes

1. **Admin Token Refresh Fix**
   - Fixed token storage in mock admin service
   - Added consistent storage management (localStorage/sessionStorage)
   - Improved token refresh mechanism with proper storage updates
   - Enhanced error handling and logging for token refresh
   - Added proper expiry time management

2. **JWT Token Format Fix**
   - Fixed JWT token generation to include proper header, payload, and signature
   - Implemented HMAC SHA-256 signing
   - Added proper base64URL encoding for all token parts
   - Verified token format in all authentication flows

3. **AdminAPI Configuration**
   - Added `withCredentials: true` to the axios instance in `frontend/src/services/adminApi.ts`
   - This enables sending cookies with cross-origin requests, essential for proper CSRF token handling

4. **Backend CORS Headers Enhancement**
   - Updated the `set_cors_headers` function in `backend/auth/config.php`
   - Added `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header
   - Added `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-CSRF-Token` to expose the CSRF token to the frontend
   - Ensured all necessary CORS headers are properly set for authentication endpoints

## Testing Results

1. ✅ Admin Token Refresh
   - Successfully storing tokens in appropriate storage
   - Proper expiry time management
   - Correct storage selection based on remember me setting
   - Enhanced error handling and recovery

2. ✅ CSRF Token Generation
   - Successfully retrieving tokens
   - Proper header inclusion
   - Secure session handling

3. ✅ Login Functionality
   - JWT tokens properly formatted
   - Refresh tokens working
   - Rate limiting functioning
   - Remember me working

4. ✅ User Profile
   - JWT validation working
   - Data filtering correct
   - Secure headers set

5. ✅ Token Refresh
   - Token rotation working
   - CSRF validation active
   - User data properly handled

✅ User Registration
- Creates users with proper usernames
- Stores verification tokens
- Logs registration events

✅ Email Verification
- Development mode returns verification URLs
- Verification tokens properly stored and checked
- Status updates correctly

✅ Auth Logging
- All events properly logged
- No more truncation issues
- Detailed event information stored

## Remaining Issues

1. **Production Readiness**
   - Review the `auth-production-checklist.md` document before deploying to production
   - Ensure rate limiting settings are properly configured
   - Review CORS settings to ensure they're properly locked down for production
