# Authentication Migration: Clerk to Custom JWT

## Overview
This document outlines the migration from Clerk authentication to a custom JWT-based authentication system in the CharterHub application.

## Changes Made

### Backend
1. **JWT Token Endpoint**:
   - Created an ultra-minimal token endpoint (`backend/ultra-minimal-token.php`) that directly accesses the database
   - Implemented secure password verification against WordPress hashed passwords
   - Returns JWT token with user data for successful authentication
   - Optimized for performance by minimizing dependencies

2. **WordPress Integration**:
   - Leveraged WordPress JWT plugin for token generation
   - Created a custom endpoint that reuses the JWT plugin's functionality
   - Ensures compatibility with existing WordPress user management

### Frontend
1. **Authentication Context**:
   - Removed all Clerk dependencies from the codebase
   - Implemented a custom `AuthContext` for managing authentication state
   - Added JWT token storage and renewal logic

2. **Component Updates**:
   - Updated the following components to use the custom auth context:
     - `ProtectedRoute.tsx`
     - `ClientLayout.tsx`
     - `Profile.tsx`
     - `Dashboard.tsx`
     - `Settings.tsx`
   - Replaced Clerk user interface components with custom implementations

3. **User Experience**:
   - Maintained consistent UX during the transition
   - Added loading states for authentication-dependent components
   - Implemented profile display and management screens

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login credentials to the token endpoint
2. Backend verifies credentials against the database
3. If valid, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client
4. Frontend stores the token and user data in the auth context
5. Protected routes check the auth context for valid authentication
6. Token is included in headers for authenticated API requests

### Security Considerations
- Passwords are securely hashed in the database (WordPress standard)
- JWT tokens are signed to prevent tampering
- Tokens have expiration dates to limit vulnerability
- Authorization checks are performed on both client and server sides

## Future Improvements
- Implement refresh token functionality for extended sessions
- Add rate limiting for login attempts
- Integrate CAPTCHA for registration and login forms
- Develop email verification workflow
- Create password reset functionality
