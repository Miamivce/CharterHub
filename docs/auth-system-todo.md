- [x] Added rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- [x] Enhanced error handling with specific error types
- [x] Implemented proper CORS configuration
- [x] Fixed JWT token format with proper header, payload, and signature
- [x] Implemented secure token refresh with rotation
- [x] Added comprehensive testing of auth endpoints
- [x] Fixed admin token refresh mechanism
- [x] Implemented proper storage management for admin tokens
- [x] Added enhanced error handling for token refresh

   - Secure session handling

3. **Login Endpoint** ✅
   - JWT tokens properly formatted (header.payload.signature)
   - Refresh tokens generated and stored
   - Rate limiting functioning correctly
   - Remember me functionality working

4. **User Profile (/me)** ✅
   - JWT validation working
   - Proper data filtering
   - Secure headers implemented

5. **Token Refresh** ✅
