# CharterHub - Project Context

## Overview
CharterHub is designed to streamline the management of yacht charter bookings, facilitating communication between administrators and customers. The application consists of two separate interfaces:

1. **Admin Portal**: Allows administrators to manage bookings, customers, documents, and yacht/destination information.
2. **Customer Portal**: Enables customers to view their bookings, upload documents, and explore available yachts and destinations.

## Architecture

### Frontend Application (Primary)
- Standalone React application
- Custom authentication system:
  - JWT-based authentication for both client and admin interfaces
  - Custom-built auth context and protected routes
  - PHP backend integration for authentication endpoints
- Uses local MySQL database (`charterhub_local`)
- Currently using mock data for development with WordPress integration for yachts and destinations
- Designed for future complete API integration

### PHP Authentication Backend
- Provides comprehensive authentication system:
  - User login with JWT token generation
  - User logout with token invalidation
  - Password reset request and processing
  - Token refresh mechanism
  - Email verification
  - Invitation management
- Uses MySQL database with WordPress-compatible table structure
- Implements security best practices:
  - Secure password hashing
  - JWT token management
  - Authentication logging
  - Rate limiting configuration

### WordPress Backend (for Content)
- Provides content management for yachts and destinations
- Acts as the content source for the React application

5. Set up real-time notification system
6. Integrate payment processing
7. Conduct comprehensive testing
8. Prepare for production deployment:
   - Set up production environment variables
   - Configure backup systems
   - Set up monitoring and logging

## Development Environment

### Local Setup
- Frontend application running independently
- Local MySQL database (`charterhub_local`)
- PHP development server for authentication API
- Authentication test credentials:
  - Admin user: admin@charterhub.com / admin123
  - Manager: manager@charterhub.com / password
  - Client: client1@charterhub.com / password

### Database Structure
- wp_users table
- wp_charterhub_invitations table
- wp_charterhub_auth_logs table
- (mock tables for development)
