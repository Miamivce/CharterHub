## Destination ID Format Fix Implementation

### Issue Overview
The application was experiencing issues with destination detail pages showing incorrect content due to ID format mismatches between WordPress and sample data services.

### Root Causes
1. **ID Format Inconsistency**:
   - WordPress API uses numeric IDs (e.g., `123`)
   - Sample data service uses prefixed string IDs (e.g., `destination-001`)
   - No consistent ID format handling in the `getDestination` method

2. **Caching Issues**:
   - Cached data wasn't being properly utilized
   - Fallback to sample data wasn't handling ID formats correctly

### Implementation Details

#### 1. ID Format Handling
- Added ID format detection and conversion in `getDestination`
- Implemented extraction of numeric IDs from prefixed strings
- Preserved original ID format in transformed destinations

#### 2. Cache Management
- Enhanced cache checking before API calls
- Improved cache fallback after API failures
- Added proper error logging for cache misses

#### 3. Sample Data Integration
- Updated sample data fallback mechanism
- Ensured consistent ID format preservation
- Added logging for sample data fallbacks

### Code Changes

1. **WordPressService Updates**:
   - Enhanced `getDestination` method with ID format handling
   - Updated `transformDestination` to preserve ID formats
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. **Cache Handling**:
   - Added cache checks before API calls
   - Implemented proper cache invalidation
   - Enhanced error recovery with cache fallback

### Testing
- Verified destination detail page navigation
- Confirmed correct content display for all ID formats
- Tested cache fallback scenarios
- Validated sample data integration

### Future Considerations
1. **ID Format Standardization**:
   - Consider standardizing ID formats across services
   - Implement ID format validation at service boundaries

2. **Cache Strategy**:
   - Evaluate cache duration settings
   - Consider implementing cache warming
   - Monitor cache hit/miss rates
