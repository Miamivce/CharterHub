# CharterHub Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview

The CharterHub authentication system has been successfully implemented using a secure PHP-based backend with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. This implementation provides a complete authentication flow for the CharterHub application, enabling user registration, login, password reset, and token refresh capabilities.

## Authentication Endpoints

The following authentication endpoints have been implemented:

1. **User Login** (`/auth/login.php`)
   - Authenticates users and generates JWT tokens
   - Returns user data and refresh token
   - Logs authentication attempts
   - Implements rate limiting for security

2. **User Logout** (`/auth/logout.php`)
   - Invalidates refresh tokens
   - Requires valid JWT token
   - Logs logout actions

3. **Password Reset Request** (`/auth/request-password-reset.php`)
   - Generates secure reset tokens
   - Sends reset instructions via email
   - Implements anti-enumeration protection
   - Sets token expiration

4. **Password Reset** (`/auth/reset-password.php`)
   - Validates reset tokens
   - Enforces password requirements
   - Updates user passwords securely
   - Logs password reset actions

5. **Token Refresh** (`/auth/refresh-token.php`)
   - Extends user sessions
   - Implements token rotation
   - Validates refresh tokens
   - Logs token refresh actions

6. **Email Verification** (`/auth/verify-email.php`)
   - Verifies user email addresses
   - Uses secure tokens
   - Prevents unauthorized account access
   - Logs verification attempts

7. **User Registration** (`/auth/register.php`)
   - Creates new user accounts
   - Enforces password policies
   - Sends verification emails
   - Logs registration attempts

8. **User Invitation** (`/auth/invite.php`)
   - Allows admins to invite new users
   - Generates secure invitation links
   - Options to link invitations to bookings
   - Logs invitation actions

## Database Schema

The authentication system uses the following database tables:

1. **`wp_users`** - Stores user information
   - Authentication credentials (email, password)
   - Personal information (name, contact details)
   - Role-based permissions
   - Token storage (refresh, verification, reset)
   - Activity tracking

2. **`wp_charterhub_invitations`** - Manages user invitations
   - Secure invitation tokens
   - Expiration timestamps
   - Booking associations
   - Usage tracking

3. **`wp_charterhub_auth_logs`** - Logs authentication activities
   - Login/logout attempts
   - Password resets
   - Email verifications
   - Token refreshes
   - Success/failure status
   - IP address and user agent data

## Security Features

The authentication system implements the following security measures:

1. **Secure Password Handling**
   - Passwords hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` with bcrypt
   - Configurable password requirements
   - Secure password reset flow

2. **JWT Implementation**
   - Configurable token expiration
   - Token signing with secret key
   - Refresh token rotation

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Configurable maximum login attempts
   - Temporary account lockout after failed attempts
   - IP-based tracking

4. **Anti-Enumeration Protection**
   - Generic error messages
   - Consistent response timing
   - No information leakage about existing accounts

5. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - All authentication actions logged
   - IP address and user agent tracking
   - Success/failure status recorded
   - Detailed context information

6. **CORS and Security Headers**
   - Configurable CORS settings
   - Proper content type headers
   - Options for different environments

## Configuration

The authentication system is configured via `config.php` with the following settings:

```php
// Authentication settings
$auth_config = [
    'jwt_secret' => 'your-jwt-secret-key', // Change this in production
    'jwt_expiration' => 3600, // 1 hour
    'refresh_expiration' => 2592000, // 30 days
    'password_min_length' => 8,
    'invitation_expiration' => 7, // days
    'verification_expiration' => 48, // hours
    'max_login_attempts' => 5,
    'lockout_time' => 30, // minutes
];
```

## Implementation Status

All core authentication endpoints have been successfully implemented and are ready for integration with the frontend. The system has been designed with security best practices in mind and includes comprehensive logging for security monitoring.

## Development Mode

The auth system includes a development mode to help with testing and implementation. In development mode, several features are enabled:

- Email sending is bypassed (emails are logged to console instead)
- Verification and password reset URLs are exposed in API responses
- Timeouts are increased for easier debugging
- A verification link popup is shown after registration

### Verification Link Popup

In development mode, after a user registers, a popup will appear with the verification link. This allows developers to:

1. See the verification link without having to check emails or server logs
2. Click directly on the link to verify the account
3. Copy the link to the clipboard

This feature is automatically enabled when `DEVELOPMENT_MODE` is set to `true` in the backend configuration.

### Timeout Configuration

For development and testing, we have increased timeouts:

1. Frontend API Timeout: Increased from 30 seconds to 90 seconds in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
2. PHP Execution Time: Increased to 90 seconds for authentication endpoints using `set_time_limit(90)`

### Important Note for Production

When deploying to production:

1. Set `DEVELOPMENT_MODE` to `false` in `config.php`
2. Replace the development mode email logging with actual email sending functionality
3. Ensure all verification links and sensitive data are not exposed in API responses
4. Disable verification link popup functionality
5. Review timeout settings based on expected load and response times

Failing to disable development mode in production could result in security vulnerabilities, including exposure of verification links.

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update React authentication context to use new endpoints
   - Implement token refresh mechanism in frontend
   - Update login, registration, and password reset forms
   - Test all authentication flows end-to-end

2. **Production Readiness**
   - Update JWT secret for production
   - Configure proper CORS restrictions
   - Implement server-side rate limiting
   - Set up proper error monitoring
   - Implement CSRF protection for sensitive operations

3. **Enhanced Security (Future)**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - OAuth integration for social login
   - Advanced password policies
   - IP-based suspicious activity detection

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache frequently used queries
   - Optimize database indexes
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Set up monitoring for authentication endpoints

## Testing

To test the authentication endpoints, you can use the following tools:

1. **cURL Commands**
   ```bash
   # Login
   curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"admin@charterhub.com","password":"admin123"}' \
     http://localhost:8000/auth/login.php
   
   # Request password reset
   curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"admin@charterhub.com"}' \
     http://localhost:8000/auth/request-password-reset.php
   ```

2. **Postman Collection**
   - Import the provided Postman collection
   - Test all authentication endpoints
   - Verify proper error handling
   - Check response formats

The authentication system is now ready for integration with the frontend application.
